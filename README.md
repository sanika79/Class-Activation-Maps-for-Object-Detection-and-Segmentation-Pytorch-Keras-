# Class-Activation-Maps-for-Object-Detection-and-Segmentation-Pytorch-Keras

This is one of many ways to visualize and get insights from a Convolutional Neural Network. What this basically does is that it creates a heatmap of "Class Activation" over the input image.

A "class activation" heatmap is a 2D grid of scores associated with an specific output class, computed for every location in any input image, indicating how important each location is with respect to the class considered.

Quite simply, it tells us which features the model is looking for. Keras will be the deep framing framework that is going to be utilized.
